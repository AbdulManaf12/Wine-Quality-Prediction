# Wine Quality Prediction

In the world of wine production, ensuring consistent quality is crucial for winemakers and consumers alike. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features. By leveraging historical data and utilizing advanced algorithms, the model offers a valuable tool for winemakers to assess and enhance wine quality.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical characteristics. The quality is categorized as either "bad" or "good" based on predefined thresholds. The challenge is to build a classification model that can accurately classify wines into these quality categories using the available features.

## Solution

To tackle this problem, a dataset containing physicochemical attributes of wines, along with their corresponding quality ratings, is used. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or relationships between the features and wine quality. Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier are trained on the dataset to build a predictive model. Grid search with cross-validation is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the model and improve its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which contains various physicochemical attributes of wines, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The quality of wines is rated on a scale from 3 to 9, with higher values indicating better quality.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Confusion Matrix: A matrix that summarizes the model's predictions against the actual wine quality labels, providing insights into the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- Classification Report: A report that presents precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each quality category, allowing for a detailed evaluation of the model's performance.
- Accuracy Score: The overall accuracy of the model in correctly predicting wine quality.

## Conclusion

The developed machine learning model provides a solution for predicting the quality of wines based on their physicochemical attributes. By leveraging historical data and employing advanced algorithms, the model enables winemakers to assess and enhance wine quality with greater accuracy. However, it's important to note that the model's predictions should be used as a complementary tool alongside expert knowledge and sensory evaluations. Further refinement and validation of the model can be conducted to improve its accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios.
